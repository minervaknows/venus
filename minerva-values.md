# Minerva's Values
---
People are most engaged and happiest when they have a goal they believe in, a
community working together in pursuit of that goal, and feel the community
collectively has the power (agency) to achieve the goal. Our purpose is to
create a large community composed of many smaller communities built around the
goal of elegantly serving one another by making process knowledge and expertise
you can trust instantly accessible wherever you need it right when you need it.

These are the values that define our community:

## Strive For Elegance 
Minablers never utilize “utilize” when they can use “use.” Elegance is the key
to delighting our community.

## &
In the movie production community, “and” implies an additive contribution, but
doesn’t mean the parties ever worked together. When you see credits with an “&”
it represents a close partnership. Our community is about real partnership.

Minablers are dedicated to creating an inclusive community in the service of
others. We seek to engage community members in the ways that are most
comfortable for them in order to serve our network through the value derived
from those connections.

- Our community is created by a shared commitment to our values.
- We value diversity in all forms as the foundation of a strong community.
- We actively seek to support all members of our community.

## Be Accessible
Minablers actively pursue avenues to increase community and accessibility. We
are hungry to hear how we are failing on these fronts and to work on tearing
down existing barriers alongside those who do not feel welcome or do not have
access. Fighting for accessibility ranges from bad user experience design to
missing alt text tags and beyond. We will get this wrong. A lot. It is our
commitment to continually do better little by little.

- Strive for inclusivity in everything we do.
- Maintain the broadest possible definition of inclusivity and accessibility.
- Actively find people we are failing and seek first to listen, then build
understanding, and finally to cocreate a plan to improve.

## Commit to Service
Minablers commit ourselves to serving those we interact with in order to enable
them to reach their goals. We hope this inspires those we serve in turn to serve
others. Ours is a community built on service.

- We’re here to help, empower, and serve other Minablers, clients, and partners.
- Managers and leaders are in place to serve the people they manage and lead,
not the other way around.
- Ask what someone needs and work to help them receive it.

## Engender Trustworthiness
Minablers act with honor in all things, even when it is difficult. Without
trust, there is no community. Without honor, there is no trust. We cannot and
will not please everyone all the time, but we commit to being honest and
transparent in our goals and our actions.

- Do not lie, act deviously, or otherwise harm your reputation or that of
Minerva through deceit of any sort.
- Be honest in sharing what you know and what you don’t. Do not make things up.
- When mistakes happen (and they will) own up to them, make a real apology, and
a public commitment to do better.
- Hold yourself and other Minablers accountable for this and all other values
in a kind and supportive manner, with the goal of empowering people to grow as
opposed to demeaning or belittling.

## Act With Vision
Minablers look to the future in order to understand how we can best serve our
community. This will lead to disagreements. (If it doesn’t we aren’t being
bold enough!) Use differences of opinion and task conflict to come to
integrative solutions. Do not settle for compromise. Don’t acquiesce. Do the
work to integrate divergent ideas in order to find a compelling vision of the
future we are all proud of and excited to achieve. Then, get to work creating
that future by taking risks, failing, and learning from failure. We aim to
pursue mastery and growth over superficially displaying competence in low-risk
endeavors. Aim high and take risks, failure be damned.
